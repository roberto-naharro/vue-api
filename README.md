# vue-api

There are two folders with two differrent npm packages, [frontend](./frontend) and [backend](./backend).

The scripts are the same for both:

- "serve": launch the application in the local machine
- "build": create the bundles,
- "test:unit": do unit testing,
- "lint": finds and fixes linter problems.

## frontend

The server is running in http://localhost:8080/

## backend

The server is running in http://localhost:8080/

## TODO

- More unit test and code coverage.
- e2e testing to the backend API (simulating real calls) and to the frontend (checking elements)
- Swagger API documentation
- Storybook to check different frontend components
